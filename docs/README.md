# Shoutbomb-Polaris Integration

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Daviess-County-Public-Library organization name has been changed to **dcplibrary.**  The new URL for this repository is [**https://github.com/dcplibrary/shoutbomb-polaris-integration**](https://github.com/dcplibrary/shoutbomb-polaris-integration)
{% endhint %}

## Overview

The Daviess County Public Library uses a series of scripts and scheduled tasks to integrate our Integrated Library System (ILS), Polaris, with the Shoutbomb notification service. Shoutbomb provides SMS (text messaging) and voice (phone) notification services for libraries and allows patrons to manage their accounts.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You must have administrator privileges and physical or remote desktop access to your Polaris server. If your Polaris server is hosted by Innovative, it may be possible to modify the scripts to fit your needs.
